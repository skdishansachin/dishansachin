        I'm a backend engineer and a writer from Sri Lanka. I work at Ruzzz and
        I love creating products and telling their stories. I'm pretty good at
        Laravel (PHP) and Django (Python), and I'm not just into building stuff
        - I also like to understand how things work and share my knowledge with
        others.

        I'm always looking for ways to give back to the open-source community.
        Whether it's decoding complex code or making tricky concepts easier to
        understand, I'm up for the challenge.
