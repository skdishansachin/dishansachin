Hi there, I'm Dishan Sachin, and this is my open portfolio repository. It's open for everyone to explore and gain inspiration from.

### Tools I Used:

-   Astro (without any additional frameworks)
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Vercel for deployment and web analytics
-   Dub for link shortening and tracking

Feel free to use this as a template for your own portfolio, but please refrain from directly copying it. I'm confident you can create something even better! If you do, I'd love it if you could share it with me on Twitter [@dishansachin](https://dub.sh/rxQSjFM).

### Inspiration and Credits:
